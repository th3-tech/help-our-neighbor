1~'Well hello there, what brings you to my house?’ / I’m running for town council and would like your vote!::;  I’m your long lost grand kid ::; How is your day going? ::
1~Oh, you're running for council? How sweet… Be careful though, you might have some… competition… ::
1~Her airy aura now puts you at unease, and the sugary perfume seems almost suffocating now. You rush through your goodbyes and leave quickly.
1~She gives you a confused look. 'I have no children… who are you?
1~You stammer 'Uhhh, I must have the wrong house, sorry’. You spin around and sprint off her property, with her calling after you. 
1~Well, my day is going great! I just started my own campaign for the town council. Aren’t you doing your own little council thing? You best be prepared for some competition.
