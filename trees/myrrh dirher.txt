1~'Hello there’ he says, in a monotone voice, 'I’m afraid you’ve caught me in the middle of something. Why are you here’ \ Uhhh… political campaigner?::; Have you heard about communism?::; How is your job?:: 

1~'campaigner, huh…’ . He takes an uncomfortably long pause. 'Are you on Ascotson’s party?’ he says plainly, yet you can sense the palpable disdain \’uh… no’::; 'No’::; 'not really…’ 

1~'you aren’t, huh… You didn’t seem so sure there…’ 

1~You back away slowly. with him still eyeing you down. As soon as you are far away, you book it into the woods. :

1~He stares at you for a moment too long, and you feel a sense of dread, but he finally talks. 'Well, that’s good. I hate what they’re doing to our environment… digging up the parks, dredging the lakes… I hate to see what they might find…’  'Well, uh, um, our party is very against, uh, the urbanization of our old growth forests and nature?’ ::; 'why uh, would you be worried about that?’

1~his brow barely twitched, yet you could tell he was angry. 'You know… you ask an awful lot of questions, huh?’

1~Myrrh seemed to smile slightly, putting you at ease. 'Ah… that’s nice…’, 'We need more candidates who care about… the environment. What are your views on policing’ \ 'Well, us communists believe in less policing overall, as it is a tool to oppress the um, the masses?’ ::; 'Well, we want more policing overall, so we can uh, keep our town safe’ ::; 

1~The man steps forward. 'Well you see, I don't quite… agree with those policies, and I wouldn't want someone with those policies in our town … council’. You fight the urge to run and back away slowly, stammering out some inane goodbyes.

1~Myrrh’s expression does not change, yet you can tell he’s happy. 'Hmmm… We need more people like you in our town government. I’ll be on your side in the future’

1~You say your goodbyes, and walk off of the property. Once you duck out of the trees, you release a breath you didn’t know you were holding.
